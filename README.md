# Iris Flower Classification
This Project is a part of Data Science internship at Oasis Infobyte. This project implements Machine Learning model for iris flower classification using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm.The app is built with Streamlit, allowing users to interactively input sepal and petal measurements to predict the species of an Iris flower.

## Features

- Streamlit web application for easy interaction
- KNN algorithm for flower classification
- Pair plot visualization for data exploration
- Model evaluation metrics displayed for accuracy assessment

## How to Run:
- Clone this repository.
- Install the required libraries using `**pip install -r requirements.txt**`.
- Run the Streamlit app with streamlit `**run app_streamlit.py**`.
